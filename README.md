# sudo
native sudo for windows
### Why yet another sudo for windows
I couldn't find on github one that would meet my needs:
* open source with simple implementation that I could check
* written in C or C++ so I can compile it my self without installing 3rd party software
* native executable without dependencies
* running elevated commands in same command prompt window
* working output and input redirection
* integration with UAC standard dialog
### Features
* integration with UAC dialog
* running command in same command prompt window
* working pipe redirection
* no dependencies (native windows executable)
* passing through return codes
* not waiting for GUI process to exit
